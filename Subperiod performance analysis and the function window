Subperiod performance analysis and the function window
0xp
In the previous exercise you computed the performance measure on each possible sample of a fixed size by rolling through time. Often investors are interested in the performance of a specific subwindow. You can create subsets of a time series in R using the function window(). The first argument is the return series that needs subsetting. The second argument is the starting date of the subset in the form "YYYY-MM-DD", and the third argument is the ending date in the same format.

In this exercise you will be working with the daily S&P 500 returns which is available as the object sp500_returns
# Fill in window for 2008
sp500_2008 <- window(sp500_returns, start  = "2008-01-01", end = "2008-12-31")

# Create window for 2014
sp500_2014 <- window(sp500_returns, start = "2014-01-01", end = "2014-12-31")

# Plotting settings 
par( mfrow = c(1, 2) , mar=c(3, 2, 2, 2))
names(sp500_2008) <- "sp500_2008"
names(sp500_2014) <- "sp500_2014"

# Plot histogram of 2008
chart.Histogram(sp500_2008, methods = c("add.density", "add.normal"))

# Plot histogram of 2014
chart.Histogram(sp500_2014, methods = c("add.density", "add.normal"))
