Interpreting correlation
0xp
Now you will learn how to compute the correlation between equity returns and bond returns. Just like volatilities, these correlations are dynamic. Therefore you need to distinguish between a static analysis that calculates correlations over a complete sample, and a dynamic analysis that calculates correlations over a rolling sample. This is a similar analysis as you did for the time-varying performance evaluation in terms of mean return and volatility.

In this exercise you will learn 3 new functions from the PerformanceAnalytics package: chart.Scatter(), chart.Correlation(), and chart.RollingCorrelation().

Instructions
Plot the equity returns (returns_equities) against the bond returns (returns_bonds) using the function chart.Scatter() with the bond returns on the x-asis. Do you see a relation?
Compute the correlation between the variables returns_equities and returns_bonds using cor().
Merge returns_equities, and returns_bonds using merge(). Call this returns.
Compute and visualize the correlation again, using chart.Correlation() with returns as the argument.
Compute the rolling 24-month estimates of the bond-equity correlation using the function chart.RollingCorrelation().

# Create a scatter plot
chart.Scatter(returns_bonds, returns_equities)

# Find the correlation
cor(returns_equities, returns_bonds)

# Merge returns_equities and returns_bonds 
returns <- merge(returns_equities, returns_bonds)

# Find and visualize the correlation using chart.Correlation
chart.Correlation(returns)

# Visualize the rolling estimates using chart.RollingCorrelation
chart.RollingCorrelation(returns_equities, returns_bonds, width = 24)
