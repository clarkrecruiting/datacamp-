Define ko_pep as the ratio expressing the value of the 
share price of the Coca Cola company in terms of the share price of PepsiCo.
Use plot.zoo() to visualize the variation in this ratio over time. 
Note that when the value of the ratio is larger than 1, the performance of ko since January 2003 is higher than that of pep.
As a reference line, use abline() to include a horizontal line at h=1. 
Note that where the value of the ratio is larger than one, the the Coca Cola Company outperforms Pepsico and vice versa
This is used for caulcating simple returns. 

# Define ko_pep 
ko_pep <- ko / pep 

# Make a time series plot of ko_pep
  plot.zoo(ko_pep)
  
# Add as a reference, a horizontal line at 1
  abline(h=1)
